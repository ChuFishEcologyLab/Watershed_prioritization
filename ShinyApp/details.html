<h3 id="about-this-application">About this Application</h3>
<p>This app ranks watersheds for conservation objectives based on the
methods outlined in [PAPER REFERENCE]</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="watershed-scale">Watershed scale</h5>
<p>The unit of watersheds at which the prioritization is done. Options
include Hydrobasin level 5 and 6 from SOURCE. Level 5 watersheds are
larger than level 6.</p>
<h5 id="weighting-schema">Weighting schema</h5>
<p>Create a custom weighting scheme, or select one of the schemes meant
to select watersheds for area-based protection, restoration, species at
risk management or invasive species management from [PAPER
REFERENCE]</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Select weights for the 6 variables below to help identify
priority watersheds for conservation. Positive weight vales (i.e. &gt;
0) will select watersheds with large values of the variable, while
negative weight values (i.e. &lt; 0) will select watersheds with low
values of the variable. Weight values of 0 indicate that the variable
should be ignored when selecting watersheds.</em></strong></p>
<h5 id="watershed-stress">Watershed stress</h5>
<p>Intensity of human impact in a watershed based on the Global Human
Modification dataset (Hirsh-Pearson 2022. FACETS). Normalized range of
0-100.</p>
<h5 id="fish-species-at-risk-sar-richness">Fish species at risk (SAR)
richness</h5>
<p>Number of COSEWIC listed fish species at risk with a watershed.
Normalized range of 0-100.</p>
<h5 id="fish-species-richness">Fish species richness</h5>
<p>Number of fish species (including native, foreign and translocated
species) within a watershed. Normalized range of 0-100.</p>
<h5 id="fish-biodiversity-change">Fish biodiversity change</h5>
<p>Index of the relative rarity of fish species within in the amount,
from Minns (1987) NZ J Zool. Normalized range of 0-100.</p>
<h5 id="fish-biodiversity-change-1">Fish biodiversity change</h5>
<p>Index of the amount of change in a fish community between historical
(ie 1960s) and current periods. Most of this change is driven by
invasive species. Normalized range of 0-100.</p>
<h5 id="climate-change">Climate change</h5>
<p>Index of the amount of climate change predicted in a watershed by
2055 under an RCP 4.5 scenario. Normalized range of 0-100.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="watersheds-ranked-within-ecoregions">Watersheds ranked within
ecoregions?</h5>
<p>Select whether you want watersheds to be ranked within their
freshwater ecoregion (i.e. high rankings = high for that ecoregion).
Default (unchecked) value is that rankings are conducted at a national
scale.”</p>
