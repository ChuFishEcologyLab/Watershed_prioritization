### About this Application

This app ranks watersheds for conservation objectives based on the methods outlined in [PAPER REFERENCE]

----

##### Watershed scale

The unit of watersheds at which the prioritization is done. Options include Hydrobasin level 5 and 6 from SOURCE. Level 5 watersheds are larger than level 6.
  
##### Weighting schema
      
Create a custom weighting scheme, or select one of the schemes meant to select watersheds for area-based protection, restoration, species at risk management or invasive species management from [PAPER REFERENCE]

----

***Select weights for the 6 variables below to help identify priority watersheds for conservation. Positive weight vales (i.e. > 0) will select watersheds with large values of the variable, while negative weight values (i.e. < 0) will select watersheds with low values of the variable. Weight values of 0 indicate that the variable should be ignored when selecting watersheds.***


##### Watershed stress

Intensity of human impact in a watershed based on the Global Human Modification dataset (Hirsh-Pearson 2022. FACETS). Normalized range of 0-100.

##### Fish species at risk (SAR) richness

Number of COSEWIC listed fish species at risk with a watershed. Normalized range of 0-100.


##### Fish species richness

Number of fish species (including native, foreign and translocated species) within a watershed. Normalized range of 0-100.

##### Fish biodiversity change
        
Index of the relative rarity of fish species within in the amount, from Minns (1987) NZ J Zool. Normalized range of 0-100.

##### Fish biodiversity change

Index of the amount of change in a fish community between historical (ie 1960s) and current periods. Most of this change is driven by invasive species. Normalized range of 0-100.

##### Climate change

Index of the amount of climate change predicted in a watershed by 2055 under an RCP 4.5 scenario. Normalized range of 0-100.

##### Watersheds ranked within ecoregions?

Select whether you want watersheds to be ranked within their freshwater ecoregion (i.e. high rankings = high for that ecoregion). Default (unchecked) value is that rankings are conducted at a national scale."
