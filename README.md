# Watershed_prioritization


This folder includes the data, analyses, and Shiny app built to visualize the results of efforts to priortize watersheds within Canada for four freshwater fish conservation objectives including: 
- i) area-based protection; 
- ii) habitat restoration; 
- iii) species at risk management; or 
- iv) invasive species management. 

The prioritizations were based on national spatial data of the richness, rarity, and at-risk status of fishes, the amount of climate change and other watershed stressors, and the degree of fish community change (native vs. current species present within watershed).
